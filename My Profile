Personal Information

My name is Christopher Edwards. My highest completed education so far is year 12. 
I’m a 20 year old undergraduate, studying online as I enjoy casual retail work and gaming in my spare time. 
I love playing competitive table tennis, pc building with friends, and eating japanese food out with extended family. 
I can be contacted at tab955255@gmail.com. 



What IT Means For Me

I’ve always had a strong interest in IT, ever since I was a small child, experimenting with a box shaped monitor PC my family owned. 
Ever since then, I grew up solving problems for my family, finding out about coding, and growing any knowledge in IT I could. 
In year 11, I began studying networking engineering, programming, and electrical engineering. 
With the help of great teachers and good friends, I found I loved IT and decided that it was what I would pursue as a future. 
After taking a break while I was financially unable to commit to full time study, 
I decided studying online through Open Universities Australia was the best way to pursue what I enjoy, 
where I was recommended to study through RMIT. 
I look forward to continuing this journey where I hope to improve my problem solving abilities, 
get better at focusing my abilities towards user centered design, or industrial use. 
I hope to further my group working capabilities (however that may be when working online), get better at coding, 
and gain insights about presenting data.



My Ideal Job

I would love to work as a network engineer in my future, as it could provide hands on experience with hardware, 
use coding abilities to configure the networks, and allow me to work in a set team with coworkers to build friendships with.
