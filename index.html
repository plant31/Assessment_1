<h3> Personal Information </h3> 

<p> <br> My name is Christopher Edwards. My highest completed education so far is year 12. <br>
I’m a 20 year old undergraduate, studying online as I enjoy casual retail work and gaming in my spare time. <br>
I love playing competitive table tennis, pc building with friends, and eating japanese food out with extended family. <br>
I can be contacted at tab955255@gmail.com. <br> </p>



<h3> What IT Means For Me<br> </h3>

<p> <br> I’ve always had a strong interest in IT, ever since I was a small child, experimenting with a box shaped monitor PC my family owned.<br> 
Ever since then, I grew up solving problems for my family, finding out about coding, and growing any knowledge in IT I could. <br>
In year 11, I began studying networking engineering, programming, and electrical engineering. <br>
With the help of great teachers and good friends, I found I loved IT and decided that it was what I would pursue as a future. <br>
After taking a break while I was financially unable to commit to full time study, <br>
I decided studying online through Open Universities Australia was the best way to pursue what I enjoy, <br>
where I was recommended to study through RMIT. <br>
I look forward to continuing this journey where I hope to improve my problem solving abilities, <br>
get better at focusing my abilities towards user centered design, or industrial use. <br>
I hope to further my group working capabilities (however that may be when working online), get better at coding, <br>
  and gain insights about presenting data.<br> </p>



<h3><br> My Ideal Job<br> </h3>

<p> <br>I would love to work as a network engineer in my future, as it could provide hands on experience with hardware, <br>
use coding abilities to configure the networks, and allow me to work in a set team with coworkers to build friendships with. <br>

<h3>My Project Idea<h3/>
  <p>
  <h4>Overview</h4>
For this project I would like to introduce a tool for automatically designing networks based on a user’s requirements. The program would provide the user with a menu, which would ask the user a series of questions to outline what the network’s needs are, and generate possible virtual network systems that would work for the conditions. The possible virtual networks would be outputted to the user as a series of diagrams, followed by the hardware recommendations, and configuration files for their chosen hardware. The tool could also output a detailed description of what the installation requirements of the network are and how to set the hardware up. 


  <h4>Motivation</h4>
Setting up a new large scale enterprise network can take a long time to implement, followed by issues created by unforeseen conditions placed upon the network, which can take even more time to patch or replace outdated hardware. Mistakes can often be made when implementing a network, details often overlooked, and security often not implemented properly. As new software tools are developed to make jobs easier every day, it’s easy to see why creating a network can be done in a far more streamlined process with less errors and more suited configurations. 

  <h4>Description</h4>
Firstly in the tools menu, the graphical interface supplied to the user would ask how many physical locations the network would have to connect between, and the distance between each location. This would allow the tool to begin to understand how to set up the basic router’s positions on the network, and the minimum amount of switches required to run the network. Next, the user would enter the amount of each kind of permanent device would be connected to each respective location, and an estimate of how many temporary devices would be on the network at any given time (wireless or otherwise). This is where the tool gauges what the maximum required switches are for the network, excluding cost (more on cost later), and what kind of wireless network to implement. Implementing the wireless side of the network would be difficult for the tool, as there are many location specific factors that may be unknown to the user, such as interference in high population density areas or near certain industrial equipment. This part of the tool could be difficult to accurately implement, however some simple adjustments to the questions in the menu could reduce the chance an incorrect access point is advised to the user. The user would then choose which servers to add to their network from a dropdown menu which would be under each location, so the tool knows where and how to place them, based on the purpose of the server. For the tool to generate the configuration files for the hardware, the tool’s menu will ask for the kind of information the servers will be holding, and how the clients will be accessing the information. This will allow the tool to implement the correct security protocols for the network. Finally the tool would ask for the network usage of each device during average and peak hours, so the tool can correctly apply the connections. These questions would allow the tool to understand the map of what the network would look like, provide the network redundancy required, and produce the user with the correct configuration files to install on the network hardware. If the network is outside the users budget, the user would be given an option to implement cost reduction methods such as reducing the redundancy or implementing bandwidth control to reduce hardware requirements. Based on the budget supplied by the user, the tool would also be able to generate exact product recommendations for the network hardware, and therefore the installation requirements for each network device. Network device manufacturers always supply this information readily, so assuming the tool has a database of the hardware products, this should be easy to implement in the tool.



  <h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
Aside from the GUI used to ask the user about the network conditions, the software would also have to utilize an AI to be able to create a suitable network layout given the conditions. In order to map what the network would look like, the tool would associate the parameters with certain outputs to the map, the AI would combine all the conditions together, generate a network map, and render the network.
The software would also require a way to visualise the network. Rendering the tool’s recommended network would require software similar to packet tracer, a tool used to simulate networks. This project could be used in conjunction with packet tracer, as it is an effective way to display how a network would hypothetically work. This could be done by the tool simply outputting the generated network as a packet tracer file, alongside the required descriptions of the hardware in the tool’s GUI.

  <h4>Skills Required</h4>
The programming required for this task would require an experienced software developer to implement, particularly to develop the tool’s AI which assembles the virtual network at the end. 
To set up the series of questions to use for the tool, the project would require a highly experienced network engineer. This would ensure the automatic network would have the correct conditions set, and the programmers of the project would be able to correctly identify the effect each condition is supposed to have on the virtual network.

  <h4>Outcome</h4>
If this project was successfully created, the tool will make the process of designing an industrial network much simpler and faster. As the software improves over time through updates based on feedback and improvements to the conditions by the network engineers on this project, the network quality will improve more and more, until network issues will be a thing of the past entirely. Furthermore, the configuration files to be used on the network hardware that are automatically generated by the tool would become increasingly complex, so that the implementation of the network would become even faster, by reducing the work for the network implementers.
