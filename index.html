<h1> Personal Information </h1> 

<p> <br> My name is Christopher Edwards. My highest completed education so far is year 12. <br>
I’m a 20 year old undergraduate, studying online as I enjoy casual retail work and gaming in my spare time. <br>
I love playing competitive table tennis, pc building with friends, and eating japanese food out with extended family. <br>
I can be contacted at tab955255@gmail.com. <br> </p>



<h2> What IT Means For Me<br> </h2>

<p> <br> I’ve always had a strong interest in IT, ever since I was a small child, experimenting with a box shaped monitor PC my family owned.<br> 
Ever since then, I grew up solving problems for my family, finding out about coding, and growing any knowledge in IT I could. <br>
In year 11, I began studying networking engineering, programming, and electrical engineering. <br>
With the help of great teachers and good friends, I found I loved IT and decided that it was what I would pursue as a future. <br>
After taking a break while I was financially unable to commit to full time study, <br>
I decided studying online through Open Universities Australia was the best way to pursue what I enjoy, <br>
where I was recommended to study through RMIT. <br>
I look forward to continuing this journey where I hope to improve my problem solving abilities, <br>
get better at focusing my abilities towards user centered design, or industrial use. <br>
I hope to further my group working capabilities (however that may be when working online), get better at coding, <br>
  and gain insights about presenting data.<br> </p>



<h3><br> My Ideal Job<br> </h3>

<p> <br>I would love to work as a network engineer in my future, as it could provide hands on experience with hardware, <br>
use coding abilities to configure the networks, and allow me to work in a set team with coworkers to build friendships with. <br>
